# Python Extensions in Other Languages
## Different language means - C or C++ 
### How do extensions in C or C++ work 

## Why you might want to use extensions 
### Improving performance in critical code sections 
### Integrating existing code written in different languages
### Intergrating third-party dynamic libraries 
### Creating custom datatypes 

## Writing extensions 
### Pure C extensions 
### A closer look at Python/C API 
### Calling and binding conventions 
### Exception handling 
### Release GIL 
### Reference counting 

## Cpython 
### Cpython as a source to source compiler 
### Cpython as a language 

## Challenges 
### Additional complexity
### Debugging 

## Interfacing with dynamic libraries without extensions 
### ctypes
### Loading libraries 
### Calling C function using ctypes 
### Passing Python functions as C callbacks 
### CFEI
